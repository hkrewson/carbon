#   v20140914
#   - Target checking is handled in one function. Code cleaning.
#   v20140911
#   - Error logging and parsing of log file from ditto is handled within the function cLOGGER
#       using nested functions clogger.file and clogger.ditto respectively. This grouping of
#       functions is initialized during script startup. At this point, these functions should
#       handle all the same error reporting and file logging. Log parsing should be much better.
#   v20140908
#   - Breaking things. Adding in error logging and checking for ditto, and making a large 
#       change to the way this happens. Until this is incorporated, some variables are
#       broken. Notably, the new variables for $lastERROR and $lastFERROR. Once the logging
#       function is fully replaced/implimented, these variables will be working again. Until
#       then, use an older version.
#   V20140904
#   - New version of dittoERR (). This version searches subsections of the ditto log file
#       and parses errors into one of two arrays (aERROR, or aFILE). Two arrays may be 
#       overkill for this, we may change it in the future. 
#   - Added output to display the last error recorded in the ditto log file.
#   v20140829
#   - Removed "512" from the calculation for sizeInitial. This was one cause for incorrect 
#       initial values, and incorrect percentage of completion reports.
#   - Legacy flag options 'm' and 's' removed. 
#   v20140822
#   - Began working through data from log dumps. Have only gotten through the initial phase
#       (pre-copy). Lot of data to wade through and validate.
#   - Working on time calculations. Two options. One using a longer decimal value and time
#       intensive calculations. The other is to make date do the math.
#   v20140821
#   - More logging.
#   - targTEST -- if [[ -d $(dirname "$target") ]] && [[ "$tarTEST" != "Volumes" ]]
#       Should test target directory and verify we are not creating a folder in "Volumes".
#   v20140807
#   - Adding error numbers for logging. See /usr/include/sysexits.h. File can be found at:
#       http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-320/include/sysexits.h
#   v20140805
#   - New calculation for space used. 
#   v20140312
#   - Removed option to clear messages database. Issue was resolved in 10.8.3 update.
#   - Update: additional logging for OS version verification steps.
#   - Update: added Mavericks to supported OS. Still needs testing to verify, but everything
#       should work without issue.
#	v20130613
#	- corrected the name of the log files
#   v20130521a
#   - While loop using tput cup to position the cursor instead of clearing the screen.
#	v20121027a (10.8 Fork)
#	- Testing begins for using with Mountain Lion.
#	- Added mountain lion to list of supported OS versions to begin to allow testing.
#	- Passed myLOGGER "$0 $- $@" to add the full command into the logs.
#	- Added a printed output to request all logs and a description of any success or failure.
#	v20120531
#	- $SOURCELIST was breaking when filenames contained spaces. Added temporary storage for IFS, 
#		and switched IFS=$(echo -en "\n\b"). This should allow for spaces in names. CLI testing
#		shows that it will work.
#	v20120527
#	- Changed disk image creation from type SPARSE to SPARSEBUNDLE to allow for creation on
#		fat32 formatted drives.
#	v20120516
#	- Resumed use of runtime () to calculate scriptRUNTIME. This combined with the
#		use of an array with ditto provides proper while looping feedback.
#		Prior to this, script was backgrounding multiple instances of ditto and exiting
#		before all data was copied.
#	- Added a new log file for ditto background process. $clog=carbon.copy.log
#	- Changed myTARGET test. If function is unable to create the directory, an error
#		is reported that the drive is read-only.
#	- Function isCOMPLETE generated an error in the calculation to determine if the copy
#		is complete or not. percentCOMPLETE was scaled to a precision of 2, causing the if
#		statement to always show that the copy exited early. Changed scale of precision to 0.
#		This resolves the error since bc is required for any float calculations. if is
#		changed to look for -ge 99 instead of -gt 99.
#	- Realized that in a prior revision, I removed refresh. This also removed allocation of
#		$source and $target. Added this back in just after running checkDIR.
#	- dittoERROR has been added into the final report just after isCOMPLETE. This should 
#		report any error messages.
#   v20120506
#   - Removed refresh rate options as they are never used.
#   - Created mySCALE function for code reuse.
#   - Removed older entries from embeded changelog.
#   v20120505
#   - Added -t option to myLOGGER calls. Allows message to be displayed on screen and 
#       saved to a log file.
#   v20120425
#   - Trying to redirect stdout/err to function myERROR.
#	v20120424
#	- In last testing, refresh rate of 30 seconds seemed to be too long. With the new for
#		loop, we are waiting on the information loop to transferring new files. Ditto
#		no longer has a constant stream of data. Changed default refresh to 10 seconds, 
#		may also try 5.
#	- Changed the test on the while loop to [ -n $i ], so that we are testing to see if 
#		$i contains data. This may work or may break use of ditto, as it possibly could
#		fail to pass back to the parent for loop.
#	- Since the while loop no longer tests runtime, we are commenting out. Runtime and 
#		all calls to it will be removed in future versions.
#	- Verified that $SECONDS can be passed to myTime function and provide proper results.
#	v20120421a
#	- Remove ;;s from line 719 wich was causing the script to error.
#	- Resolved array usage with ditto.
#	- Resolved array stepping with for loop.
#	- Elapsed time is now based on bash default variable $SECONDS
#
#	- TODO: Still need a valid method for the while loop (runtime of ditto is no longer good)
#			Need an adjusted method of reporting time elapsed.
#			Need to ensure the disk image function properly resets the target.
#			myLOGGER may not be functioning in the loops.
#	v20120415a
#	- Removed needlessly duplicated code in the section following getopts.
#	- New functions. 
#	- myLOGGER provides a method for appending log messages to a log file, splitting between
#		the regular log file and the error log file.
#	- Reattempting to split output of ditto to two log files.
#	V20120403A
#	- Completed first version of for loop management for Volumes folder. Folder should be
#		skipped during data transfer.
#	- Cleanup
#	- New code for reporting location should be simpler and hopefully faster as well as
#		actually work. Fingers crossed.
#	v20120402a
#	- Adding a for loop around the while loop to get rid of the Volumes folder deletion.
#	v20120324a
#	- Renaming script. Why? Because I want to. Also because carbon can autocomplete with a tab.
#	- Also reexamining versioning.
#
#   Script renamed. Some functionality has been removed to reduce bloat and because it was 
#   rarely used to the point that if we needed to do so, it was just as easy to look it up.
#   New name more accurately reflects original and current intent.
#	v1.7.3b
#	- Changes to determine whether all data was copied or not. Added two new functions
#		to facilitate this process. myERRORCOUNT and myFILECOUNT
#	v1.7.2b
#	- Further refinement of error reporting and logging. 
#	- Simplified log filename to plus.current.log.
#	- Fixed error report if statements.
#	- Change in reporting of last file copied. Currently should echo the full path of file.
#	v1.7.1b
#	- Made error scanning a function and added a call to the end of the script to report
#		what may have caused ditto to exit.
#	- Adding to the error reporting for ditto to make it more robust.
#	v1.7b
#	- Added a new section to the loop to display transfer rate speeds. 
#	- Added a new calculation to the after loop display to provide the average 
#		transfer rate.
#	v1.6.5
#	- Altered the runtime test to be -n instead of -ge. Test should now properly show 
#		time elapsed based on output from ps.
#   v1.6.4
#   - Modified $total_time to not divide by 60. This was throwing off time calculations 
#       for the total time involved.
#   - Modified while loop call to runtime(). Loop will now print runtime in separated 
#       hours, minutes and seconds instead of colon seperated.
#   - Realized the new runtime call would fail to execute properly if seconds contained 
#       a 0. Altered the call to be -ge.
#   v1.6.3
#   - Modified myTime to account for hours as well as minutes and seconds
#   - Added hours to output in order to make it easier to understand times.
#	- Updated the manual to remove two flags no longer used (-k, -x)
#	v1.6.2
#	- Call to myHelp from getopts was broken at some point in the past. Fixed this.
#	v1.6.1
#	- Changed the way it saves the log file from ditto. plus$start_time.log
#	- Working on modification of time reporting.
#	- Working on modification of data reporting for ditto progress and location.
#	v1.6.0
#	- Added new code to check the version of the current OS and verify compatibility before 
#		continuing.
#	- Code modifications to remove existing pluslog files prior to creating a new file.
#	- Code modification to better reflect transfer speeds of failing or corrupted drives.
#	- Code modification to resolve a problem with time calculation ($total_time).
#
#   List of bug fixes:
#	v1.5.4b
#	- Reverting our use of ditto and instead are removing the /Volumes folder prior to copy.
#	- Set debug on as default for the script to continue monitoring use. Removed the getopts
#		'x' option to enable debug, and removed code to turn debug on or off.
#   v1.5.3b
#   - update to the ditto command request. xargs was causing ditto to place /Macintosh HD/
#       at the root level of the drive we were copying to. Since this is unacceptable, and
#       we still need to try to keep the /Volumes folder from being copied, we are switching
#       to a single command using find -exec to locate the files and pass them to ditto
#	
#   - Unimplimented functions added to facilite streamlining of code. Fewer repetitions.
#   v1.5.1
#   - while [ -n $scriptRUNTIME ] was not properly causing the script to terminate when ditto
#       completed. Added double quotes to the variable name to properly evaluate it.
#   - scriptRUNTIME was calling ps without the -c option. This could cause scriptRUNTIME to
#       get the run time of the grep command being used to search the output of ps. If this 
#       were to happen, it might cause incorrect times or might cause the script to never terminate.
#	v1.5
#	- Sometimes the Volumes folder shows up within the root level of the hard drive 
#		(/Macintosh HD/Volumes/). Rewrote the use of ditto to avoid copying all of the volumes
#		connected. This is acheived by listing the contents of the source into an array (minus 
#		Volumes), and the passing the contents of that array via xargs into ditto.
#	- Added a new function pathString. pathString helps with the new use of ditto by checking
#		the source and target variables for a trailing '/'. If none is found, one is appended.
#	v1.4.5
#	- Set a default for variable debugON in order to not have an error when that line is parsed.
#	V1.4.4
#   - Changes to the way sizes are grabbed from du and df. df size was passing a newline 
#       character before the number causing a parse error for bc.
#   - Changes to use of command pipe strings in creating new variables. Replacing back-
#       ticks with $(). Back-ticks are an archaic format.
#   - Simplification of if statements. Create local variables to pass instead of creating 
#       two versions of one calculation.
#   v1.4.3
#	- Code change to resolve a possible error with the final While loop. Changed the test 
#       from $scriptRUNTIME > 0 to -n $scriptRUNTIME. This should avoid the scenario where 
#       it reports an error that a unary operator was expected in the while loop evaluation.
#	- Temporarily commented out the reporting feature for errors and current directory 
#       location. Example log files are needed in order to properly prepare for all 
#       reporting situations and provide accurate information.
#
#   v 1.4.1b
#   - Code changes once again to fixe time estimates and size calculations. du and df use 
#       1024 bytes as the root for calculating human readable sizes. Since Snow Leopard 
#       and Lion use 1000 bytes as the root to more accurately reflect the sizes of drives 
#       in "human" readable format, our calculations reflect this as well. We may split
#       code base to have a separate pre-SL version in order to keep consistency between 
#       the GetInfo window and sizes reported during the copy of data.
#   - Still working on the reporting of locations during the file copy as well as reporting 
#       of errors.
#   v 1.4b
#	- Code changes to fix time estimates. Estimates were incorrectly calculated in previous 
#       version, and are now more accurately reported. 
#	- Time estimate for Thunderbolt has been added, and is based upon a test performed by 
#       thenextweb.com
#	- changes to the way flags are handled to simplify the code, and in preparation for 
#       resolving an issue where the command is called with arguments but no flags and 
#       runs without error and without copying data. With no error, the user is left 
#       wondering why the command did not work. Script needs to handle this situation 
#       gracefully and provide feedback to properly inform the user of how to resolve the 
#       issue.
#	1.3b
#	- Code additions to report on current directory and last error.
#	- Code additions to provide time estimates for Thunderbolt.
#	1.2.4
#	- Resolved long standing issue where the command could be called with a destination 
#       and source but no options. Command would run with no errors, and exit without 
#       performing a copy of data. By setting an expected value for number of 
#       strings/arguments and testing for that, we now get an error message instead.
#	1.2.3
#	- Lion breaks greps use of the -o (only matching) option in conjuction with matching digits. 
#	    Switched to -e (expression) matching in order to resolve this. This option also shortens 
#       the command.
#	1.2.2
#	- Additional corrections to the variables to check the source location.
#	1.2.1
#	- While loop now tests based on scriptRUNTIME variable, and exits properly when complete.
#	1.2.0
#       - Rewrite of script to try to clean up the code. Variable names should better reflect 
#           their purpose. New function myTime to handle decimal time and present it in a 
#           human readable format. Removed some deprecated commented code that may confuse someone
#           reading through the script.
#	- Removed bugs dealing with some of the variables and causing output of sizes to be incorrect.
#       1.1.2
#       - While loop now uses calculations to determine the scale of the data copied 
#         in order to better present information (i.e. MB for sizes below .9GB)
#       - du is still used in one location, when determining the size of data to be copied
#           if the source is a folder. This is still useable in this instance, as it is only
#           run once and stored in a variable. User is warned that it will take some time
#           to determine the amount of data to copy when using this method.
#       1.1.1b
#       - Discontinue use of du command to check size of data copied.
#           du can take too long to check size of a directory when multiple
#           gigabytes of data are involved, and will cause a slow down of
#           the refresh of information as well as the process of copying data.
#       1.1.0 
#       - Adjusted diskSpace if statement to correctly asses sizes
#       - Adjusted use of df to correctly grab drive size
#       1.0.9
#       - Added two temporary variables to allow us to compare the source location 
#			to the drives in the /Volumes folder. Allows us to determine the proper
#			way to check file sizes of the source.
#   	1.0.6b
#       - More code changes to try to handle spaces in filenames
#			when passing data to ditto.
#		- Removed function to call man page from within script, as the man page
#			will properly call with the command 'man plus'.
#		- Removed unused uid variable and the unusable function to call ditto with
#			or without sudo.
#		- Removed debug 'echo' lines.
#		1.0.5 final
#		- Added double quotes to source and target variables to properly handle spaces
#	
#   	1.0.5b
#       - Code changes to try to handle spaces in filenames
#           when passing data to ditto.
#		- Code changes in use of 'du' to better handle disk space sizes.
#       1.0.2 resolved a problem in the handling of options by
#       breaking down the routine into two case statements.
#
#   But wait, where is all the stuff that happened before this? Well, as magical a time as
#   it was it is lost to the annals of history. Or not. I was spending so much time just
#   trying to figure out this scripting and versioning business that I completely ignored
#   the bits about logging changes. I should probably be drawn and quartered by those in
#   charge, however since it is I that am in charge of this monstrosity I have deemed 
#   such measures too barbaric. I suppose that I could sack the editor, but that job
#   also falls under my purview so I've decided to just let bygones be bygones. 
#
#   Did you really read all of this? Wow. Really, just wow. I don't know if I should be
#   impressed or concerned.

The best thing about this command is that it will work hard to read any file it comes across. If 
.Xr ditto 1
cannot read the file, it will log an error and move to the next file. Additionally, 
.Xr ditto 1
will also copy all associated data and meta data, including file permissions and ownership without the need to explicitly tell it to do so. Other commands with the appropriate flags will behave much the same, such as the utility
.Xr rsync 1.
However, to work properly,
.Xr rsync 1
requires specific flags and setup. Admittedly, it does have some interesting features that may make it well suited to this task."
