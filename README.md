carbon
======

Carbon was created for two reasons. First, I wanted to learn a bit about shell scripts. Second, I wanted a way to 
get feedback about the progress of ditto. 


Installing carbon
-----------------

From the command prompt, cd into the carbon folder and type:

     sudo ./install.sh

This will place carbon.sh (and rename it as carbon) in /usr/local/bin, it will also place a copy of carbon.7 in 
/usr/share/man/man7/.


Using carbon
------------

Carbon was set up to be used nearly identically to how you would run ditto. Carbon expects you to provide it with 
3 arguments: the connection type (of the slowest connected device you intend to use for the transfer), the source 
folder or drive, and the destination.

Connection types known to carbon include: u (USB), 4 (FW400), 8 (FW800), e (Ethernet), t (Thunderbolt). Carbon 
uses this and some data derived from real world data transfer tests to determine a rough estimated time of 
completion. Since my original use scenario was to copy data from corrupted drives/folders, these time estimates are
longer than would be expected from a drive in good health.

Note that the time estimates are NOT accurate, nor were they necessarily intended to be. It was intended to give a 
very rough idea of what to expect.

Copying data from the internal drive to an external USB drive named "Backup":

     carbon -u /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/ /Volumes/Backup/

Help statement can be accessed by typing:

     carbon -h

Carbon also has a man page (though admittedly I have not kept up with it as much).
   
     man carbon

Known Bugs
----------

Causing the script to exit with a ^c, can cause a 0 byte file to be created in the script's folder. As part of 
its startup, carbon looks for this file and attempts to remove it. 


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you don't include a connection type flag in your call to carbon, it will error with a usage statement. 

currently outputs a verbose log that can be read to determine the cause of any troubles.
